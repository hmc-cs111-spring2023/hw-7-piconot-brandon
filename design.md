# Design

## Who is the target for this design, e.g., are you assuming any knowledge on the part of the language users?
I am designing this language for those who do not speak picobot but wish to be able to provide him with instructions that are fairly natural langauge esc. 

## Why did you choose this design, i.e., why did you think it would be a good idea for users to express the maze-searching computation using this syntax?
I think it would be cool to have specific keywords that allow the user to guide picobot in particular directions and patterns

## What behaviors are easier to express in your design than in Picobot’s original design?  If there are no such behaviors, why not?
It should be easier to express what you want the robot to do for example, Go straight then go right might allow the robot to go straight until it cant anymore and then turn right. This example uses the kweywords of go, then, and a directional phrase.

## What behaviors are more difficult to express in your design than in Picobot’s original design? If there are no such behaviors, why not?
It may be more complex to design a while loop like fuctionality to a keyword. I was thinking about using a finished? like keyword where lets say "Go straight then go right until finished" where until describes a requirement to be met and finished correlates to a point in which the robot cannot move or finished the program.   

## On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is “very different”), how different is your syntax from PicoBot’s original design?
This syntax would be very differnet compared to the syntax of picobot so 8

## Is there anything you would improve about your design?
