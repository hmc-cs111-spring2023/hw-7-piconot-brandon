# A Picobot program that can fill an empty room

# States 0 and 1: move to the top left

# State 0: move left
0 **x* -> W 0   # go all the way to the left
0 **W* -> X 1   # can't go left anymore, so try to go up

# State 1: move up
1 x*** -> N 1  # go all the way to the top
1 N**x -> S 2  # can't go up any more, so try to go down

# States 2 and 3: fill from top to bottom, left to right

# State 2: fill this column to the bottom
2 ***x -> S 2  # go all the way to the bottom
2 *x*S -> E 3  # can't go down anymore, so try to go right

# State 3: fill this column to the top
3 x*** -> N 3  # go all the way to the top
3 Nx** -> E 2  # can't go up anymore, so try to go right

One possible way of doing this:

go left until wall //go(left).until(wall)
go up until wall 
go down until wall

until finished do: 
go right 1 then go up until wall //go(right(1)).thenGo(up).until(wall)
go right 1 then go down until wall

Possible way number 2:

go left until wall
go up until wall
go down until wall

go right 1 then (go up) or (go down) until finished 
// go(right(1)).thenGO(up.or(down)).until(finished)
// this may use () as a conditional check where if it cant do the action it returns false and does the first actions that returns true
